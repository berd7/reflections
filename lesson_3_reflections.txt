1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

if you need to work on a team and update your work so that others can see it. also can keep a backup online as well.
or if your branch is ready to be pushed online then you can push it to the remote repo.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

so that it doesn't make changes you don't want yet. if someone updated
a remote repo and git automatically updated your local repo then it
might mess up your branch. it's better to pull changes when we need to
so things don't get cluttered and messy.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

fork is cloning a repo from one github account to another. clone is
when you make a copy from a github repo to your local machine or when
you make a clone locally from one dir to another. branches happen when
you make a split from the main branch to work on a new feature without
tempering with existing code. you can then merge branches back together. when using push or pull we do so using a branch. we push a
branch up to a remote repo on github or we pull a branch down to our
local machine from github. you use clone when you want a local copy of
a repo. you use fork when making a clone on the server from another
user's repo.
