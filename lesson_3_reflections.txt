1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

if you need to work on a team and update your work so that others can see it. also can keep a backup online as well.
or if your branch is ready to be pushed online then you can push it to the remote repo.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

so that it doesn't make changes you don't want yet. if someone updated
a remote repo and git automatically updated your local repo then it
might mess up your branch. it's better to pull changes when we need to
so things don't get cluttered and messy.
