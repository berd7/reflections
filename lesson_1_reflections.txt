1.

it helps to find the changes quickly than doing it manually.

2. How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

know where changes happened and see if it is better than before

3. What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

you can choose yourself when impactful changes happen and make sense
while automatically saving could be bits and parts and not make that
much sense. or could be too many versions as a result of this.

4. Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

because was meant for coding since usually you will need multiple
files to that work together to run your application while google
docs only do it as a sort of backup so it doesn't really utilize
the groupness of the files.

5. How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

you can use git log to find the commit history with some info. to get more info use git log --stat. and you can use git diff to find the changes made from one commit to another.

6. How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

because you can always go back to a working state and fix the problem.

7. Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

mostly version control.
