1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

it turns a normal dir into a git repo. it also creates a hidden .git
dir inside the new repo where it will keep track of the commit histories. we have to make it a repo to be able to use git commands on it.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

the staging area is an intermediate step between the working dir to
the repo where it keeps all the commit history. when we make a commit
it transfers the states of the files in the staging area to repo as a
bundle. it is useful to decide which files should be committed.

3. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

you can check out the code differences using git diff --staged to
see how big the changes are and if it makes sense as one logical
change.
